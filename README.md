## Greatings üëã, I am Storm Coder
Hi there! With a robust background in systems engineering and a fervent interest in safe, concurrent programming, I have cultivated a profound expertise in using Rust to build reliable and efficient software solutions.

üî≠ **I have worked on**:

**XShell**: An open-source Rust project aimed at providing a set of cross-platform utilities for writing cross-platform and ergonomic "bash" scripts. This project showcases my ability to optimize low-level system resources while ensuring thread safety across complex operations.<br/><br/>
**Huber**: A collaborative initiative where I contribute to developing Package Install Management for GitHub, using Rust's asynchronous programming capabilities to handle high throughput and concurrency.<br/><br/>
**Dex Bot**: A trading by capturing event on Uniswap. With the specific and distinct insight about the dex exchanges, I architectured the correct trading strategy and implemented by using ether.js.<br/><br/>
**Cross Chain NFT Lending**: A LendChain project enables NFT holders to leverage their digital assets as collateral for loans, providing them with immediate liquidity without the need to sell their chershed collectibles. In this project, I developed the solitiy smart contracts on EVM and conducted audit for safety and security. <br/><br/>
**Pokedex**: An application allows us to search for your favourite Pokemon. Here I built the infrastructure to see how the Pokemons will be catched, search for our favourite Pokemon, and check out details. I accomplished both mobile and web app by improving user experience and responsiveness with React.<br/><br/>
